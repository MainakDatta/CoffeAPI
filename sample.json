Kati kati means \u201cbetween\u201d in Swahili, and this blend strikes the delicate balance between vibrant tangy notes from Kenya and the multilayered flavors and aromas of Ethiopian coffees. Our master blenders crafted this coffee as a versatile blend. Enjoy it hot to savor the slight roasting and caramel sweetness. Or you can try it iced to accentuate the floral, citrusy notes during those days of lounging in the shade.",
